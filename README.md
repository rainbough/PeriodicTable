PeriodicTable
=============

This is a Rails app designed to create an interactive periodic table. It includes element name, symbol, atomic weight, and periodic number. 

It uses the WikiWhat gem to interface with the WikiMedia API, allowing it to pull content on each of the elements from Wikipedia.
